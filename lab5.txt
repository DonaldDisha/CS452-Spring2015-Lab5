Lab #5

due: Wednesday, 4/22/15 at midnight

Write a WebGL application that cast a shadow of a 3D shape onto a rectangle, using shadow mapping.

Start with the 3D object and lights you created for Lab #3 and add a rectangle to the scene. 
Then use the shadow mapping technique to cast a shadow of the 3D object onto the rectangle.


Requirements:
1. same as Lab#3

2. use webgl-utils.js, initShaders.js and MV.js from Angel

3. three files are required in the solution: lab5.html, lab5.js and lab5.README.txt. The lab5.README.txt file
will contain your name and date along with a brief description of your solution. Note, however, that all
files should contain a comment including your name and date.

4. you must use shadow mapping
